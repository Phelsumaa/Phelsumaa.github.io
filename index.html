                <p>Our users tend to get tired of constantly
                    digging to find music that fits their needs
                    and are in search to get quality music that 
                    accurately reflects how they feel. Our solution
                    is to get away from the mainstream music 
                    applications such as YouTube, Spotify and Apple Music,
                    and provide a way for users to effortlessly 
                    sift through the musical underground.
